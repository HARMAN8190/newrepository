Topic: Introduction to Linux and Linux Installation

Tasks Completed:

Understood what an Operating System (OS) is and the key features of Linux.

Discussed different Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, Kali, Debian).

Compared Linux vs Windows (open-source, performance, security).

Learned how to install Linux in different ways:

Virtual Machine Installation using VirtualBox/VMware

Bare-metal Installation (Dual Boot/Full Disk)


Understood partitioning schemes: MBR vs GPT, and basic Linux partitions: /, /home, /swap, /boot.

Topic: Linux Shell and BASH – Basics of Command Line Interface

Tasks Completed:

Understood what a Shell is and how BASH (Bourne Again Shell) works.

Learned the Linux file system structure:

/ root directory

/home, /etc, /var, /bin, /usr, /dev, etc.


Practiced basic Linux commands:

Navigation: pwd, cd, ls

File handling: touch, mkdir, rm, rmdir, cp, mv

Viewing file content: cat, less, more
Reflection:
It was interesting to use the Linux terminal. I now understand how to move through directories and manage files through commands, which boosts efficiency over GUI.

Topic: System Opening and Internal Hardware Overview

Tasks Completed:

Physically opened a desktop system unit (CPU) under supervision.

Identified and studied the following internal components:

Motherboard – the main circuit board connecting all components

Processor (CPU) – the brain of the system

RAM (Random Access Memory) – temporary memory

SMPS (Power Supply Unit) – supplies power to components

Hard Disk Drive (HDD) and Solid-State Drive (SSD) – storage devices

Cables – SATA, power connectors, and data cables

CMOS Battery – maintains BIOS/UEFI settings


Learned how to safely open and close the system case using screwdrivers.

Understood basic safety precautions like grounding, avoiding static electricity, and careful handling of circuit boards.

Discussed how data travels through motherboard buses and how the processor communicates with memory.

Reflection:
Today’s practical session was very insightful. Opening the CPU cabinet gave me real-world experience of what I usually study in theory. I was able to clearly see how hardware components are arranged inside the system. This helped me connect software instructions with the physical devices they control.

Topic: Booting Process and Common Boot Issues

Tasks Completed:

Learned about the booting sequence of a computer system:

Power On → POST → BIOS/UEFI → Bootloader → OS


Discussed the difference between cold boot and warm boot.

Studied common boot errors like:

"Operating System Not Found"

"No Bootable Device"

"Disk Boot Failure"

Missing GRUB in Linux dual boot systems


Understood BIOS settings and boot device priorities.

Practiced troubleshooting steps:

Checking cables

Resetting BIOS

Re-installing OS or using recovery tools

Reflection:
Understanding how the system boots up helped me realize how even small misconfigurations can prevent the OS from loading. Knowing how to troubleshoot such issues is essential for both hardware and system-level support.

IP Addressing and Subnetting

Learned the basics of IP Addresses – IPv4 format (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

Understood the concept of Classes of IP: A, B, C, D, E

Practiced Subnetting: dividing networks for better traffic handling and security.

Solved subnetting problems using subnet masks like 255.255.255.0, /24, etc.
Networking Commands

Used Windows and Linux commands for basic networking checks:

ipconfig – View system IP settings (Windows)

ifconfig – View system IP settings (Linux)

ping – Test connectivity with a host

tracert / traceroute – Trace the route taken by packets
Computer Viruses & Malware

Studied types of viruses, trojans, worms, ransomware, spyware.

Discussed symptoms of infected systems: system lag, popup ads, corrupted files, etc.

Learned about antivirus tools and prevention methods:

Regular updates

Firewalls

Avoiding unknown attachments and links
