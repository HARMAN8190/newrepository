Topic: System Opening and Internal Hardware Overview

Tasks Completed:

Physically opened a desktop system unit (CPU) under supervision.

Identified and studied the following internal components:

Motherboard – the main circuit board connecting all components

Processor (CPU) – the brain of the system

RAM (Random Access Memory) – temporary memory

SMPS (Power Supply Unit) – supplies power to components

Hard Disk Drive (HDD) and Solid-State Drive (SSD) – storage devices

Cables – SATA, power connectors, and data cables

CMOS Battery – maintains BIOS/UEFI settings


Learned how to safely open and close the system case using screwdrivers.

Understood basic safety precautions like grounding, avoiding static electricity, and careful handling of circuit boards.

Discussed how data travels through motherboard buses and how the processor communicates with memory.

Reflection:
Understanding how the system boots up helped me realize how even small misconfigurations can prevent the OS from loading. Knowing how to troubleshoot such issues is essential for both hardware and system-level support.

IP Addressing and Subnetting

Learned the basics of IP Addresses – IPv4 format (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

Understood the concept of Classes of IP: A, B, C, D, E

Practiced Subnetting: dividing networks for better traffic handling and security.

Solved subnetting problems using subnet masks like 255.255.255.0, /24, etc.
Networking Commands

Used Windows and Linux commands for basic networking checks:

ipconfig – View system IP settings (Windows)

ifconfig – View system IP settings (Linux)

ping – Test connectivity with a host

tracert / traceroute – Trace the route taken by packets
Computer Viruses & Malware

Studied types of viruses, trojans, worms, ransomware, spyware.

Discussed symptoms of infected systems: system lag, popup ads, corrupted files, etc.
